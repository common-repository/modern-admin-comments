Replaces the Quicktags editor by a simple TinyMCE rich text editor on the comments admin pages.

== Description ==

Enhance your administrator/moderator experience in the comments administration pages with a rich text editor.

Comment moderation shouldn’t look like coding. Also, many bloggers don’t know how to deal with HTML tags…

This simple WordPress plugin fixes this by replacing the quicktags comment editor with a simple TinyMCE rich text editor under the:

- Reply link,
- Quick Edit link,
- Edit Comment page.

It also adds a handy ‘Code’ button if you wish to insert inline code in your replies.

No options. No settings pages.

Just activate it, and enjoy your new comment editing features!
